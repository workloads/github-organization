The purpose behind Workloads is threefold.

1. Provide an opinionated, best-practices oriented workflow for deploying a job orchestration platform to popular Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
2. Provide Terraform blueprints that anyone can consume in an "off the shelf" fashion, without an "all or nothing" mindset.
3. Provide a way to easily test the limits of deploying HashiCorp Nomad everywhere as edge compute resources.
